# LaCareCortadaProject

## Midterm Exam Delivery

### What is this delivery?

This delivery contains only the frontend of the website.

### Additional Info

The website includes a hidden page that acts as the admin dashboard. To access this page, add `/adminpanel` to the URL. Once the backend and specific JWT implementation are in place, this will become a secure endpoint, accessible only to users with the admin role.
